        <em><p> Hi! üëã I'm Sam and here's a little about me:
            <br><br>
            One fateful day, I took a Python class in High School and that was when I first tumbled headfirst into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
            <br><br>
            Today, I have had the privledge of learning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology xPro BootCamp to continue my passion on technology and to learn more about the wonders of the field. 
            <br><br> 
            My main focus these days is building websites and learning new languages for myself. In my free time, I have also volunteered as a Software QA Analyst  at a UK-based company called Ziax Ltd. They focus on bringing software to life. I worked as the support of all the software engineers of the company. 
            <br><br> 
            When I am not at the computer, I am usually reading, hanging out with my family and my two dogs, or volunteering at my local LGBT+ community center. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
